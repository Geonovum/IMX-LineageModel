## Requirements and approach
Within this chapter two sections are presented; Requirements and Approach. In the Requirements section the requirements for the information model are listed. In the Approach section the requirements are translated into a conceptual model which forms the basis for the logical model described in [chapter 3](#objectcatalog).

### Requirements

The following requirements have been taken into account in the approach:

1. **We should be able to identify and describe singular data items**
2. **We should be able to describe which data items contributed to the generation of a data item**
3. **We should be able to describe activities that act upon data items**
4. **We should be able to find data items that contributed to the generation of a data item**
5. **We should be able to describe how data item contributed to the generation of a data item**


### Approach

The first requirement, to identify and describe singular pieces data, is realized by the introduction of the data item objecttype as described in [IMX-Metadata](https://geonovum.github.io/IMX-Metadata/#vocabulary).

![](https://geonovum.github.io/IMX-Metadata/media/DataItem.png "Data item")

A [data item](https://geonovum.github.io/IMX-Metadata/#dfn-data-item) can be described from different perspectives. This gives a basic model, applicable for many usecases. The perspective the lineage model takes is one of provenance [[prov-o]]. The lineage model adds to this a way to connect one data item to one or more other data items it [is derived from](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#wasDerivedFrom). The latter are called [=source data item=]s, the former [=orchestrated data items=].
For the [=source data item=] it is important to know from which [=data source=] it is retrieved so that users can interpret the [=source data item=] in the context it was published in. This also allows allows users to find related information.

| Term                              | Definition                                                                                                                                                  |

| <dfn>source data item</dfn>       | A source data item is a [data item](https://geonovum.github.io/IMX-Metadata/#dfn-data-item) that serves as input for an [=orchestration activity=].         |
| <dfn>orchestrated data item</dfn> | An orchestrated data item is a [data item](https://geonovum.github.io/IMX-Metadata/#dfn-data-item) that is generated/obtained by orchestrating source data. |
| <dfn>data object</dfn>            | A data object is a contextually grouped set of [data items](https://geonovum.github.io/IMX-Metadata/#dfn-data-item).                                        |
| <dfn>data source</dfn>            | A data source is an entity which provides access to a dataset.                                                                                              |

A data example:

```json
{
  "identification": "G0200.42b3d39246840268e0530a0a28492340",
  "constructionDate": "2006",
  "registeredWith": {
    "consistOf": [
      {
        "property": "bouwjaar",
        "value": {
          "stringValue": "2006"
        },
        "subject": {
          "identificatie": "G0200.42b3d39246840268e0530a0a28492340",
          "domein": null
        },
        "wasDerivedFrom": {
          "property": "oorspronkelijkBouwjaar",
          "value": {
            "stringValue": "2006"
          },
          "subject": {
            "identificatie": "0200100000085932",
            "type": "Pand"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This, however, does not provide any insight into how the [=source data item=]\(s) were used to generate the [=orchestrated data item=]. In order to allow for this the generation itself is identified as an [=orchestration activity=], which is a type of [activity](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#Activity). This provides the information that the [data item](https://geonovum.github.io/IMX-Metadata/#dfn-data-item) is generated using orchestration techniques.

![](media/level2.2.png "A data item is generated by an activity")

```json
{
  "identification": "G0200.42b3d39246840268e0530a0a28492340",
  "constructionDate": "2006",
  "registeredWith": {
    "consistsOf": [
      {
        "property": "bouwjaar",
        "wasGeneratedBy": {
          "used": {
            "property": "oorspronkelijkBouwjaar",
            "value": {
              "stringValue": "2006"
            },
            "subject": {
              "identificatie": "0200100000085932",
              "type": "Pand"
            }
          }
        },
        "value": {
          "stringValue": "2006"
        },
        "subject": {
          "identificatie": "G0200.42b3d39246840268e0530a0a28492340",
          "domein": null
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Lastly, we provide insights into the transformation itself, the mapping used for the orchestration activity. The mapping is described in a seperate artifact called the [model mapping](https://geonovum.github.io/IMX-ModelMapping/#dfn-imx-model-mapping). This document describes the relation between two models and how data from one can be transformed to the other. The mapping is structured according to the [mapping specification](https://github.com/Geonovum/IMX-ModelMapping). The rules to generate a specific [data item](https://geonovum.github.io/IMX-Metadata/#dfn-data-item) are encompassed in a [property mapping](https://geonovum.github.io/IMX-ModelMapping/#dfn-property-mapping), which is executed during orchestration. To describe this, we introduce a specific type of [=orchestration activity=], the [=property mapping execution=].

| Term                                 | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <dfn>used</dfn>                      | Usage is the beginning of utilizing an entity by an [activity](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#Activity). Before usage, the activity had not begun to utilize this entity and could not have been affected by the entity. (based on [prov:used](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#used)) |
| <dfn>orchestration activity</dfn>    | An orchestration activity is an [activity](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#Activity) that is part of an IMX orchestration process.                                                                                                         |
| <dfn>property mapping execution<dfn> | A Property mapping execution is an [=orchestration activity=] that pertains to the execution of a [property mapping](https://geonovum.github.io/IMX-ModelMapping/#dfn-property-mapping).                                                 |

![](media/level3.2.png "A data item is generated by a property mapping execution")

The [=property mapping execution=] can be deconstructed into several smaller activities as it may include multiple intermediary results; each having a query [path](https://geonovum.github.io/IMX-ModelMapping/#dfn-path-expression) and a [=start node=], which are then combined and/or transformed into the [value](https://geonovum.github.io/IMX-Metadata/#dfn-value) of the [=orchestrated data item=]. The `PropertyMapping` is the main entity describing the steps ([path mappings](https://geonovum.github.io/IMX-ModelMapping/#dfn-path-mapping)) required to derive a specific data item in order of execution. Each step is an activity that informs the [=property mapping execution=]; which yields the [=orchestrated data item=]. As part of the lineage information we refer to elements in the mapping to provide insights into how the [=orchestrated data item=] was constructed. This allows us to convey which data items were used to derive a new data item, and how these were used. Adding this to our lineage model yields the following model.

| Term                              | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <dfn>was informed by</dfn>        | A relation between [activities](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#Activity) stating that one activity uses some output of the other activity. (based on [prov:wasInformedBy](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#wasInformedBy))           |
| <dfn>path mapping execution</dfn> | A property path execution is an [activity](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#Activity) that retrieves [data items](https://geonovum.github.io/IMX-Metadata/#dfn-data-item) to serve as input for the [=property mapping execution=]. |
| <dfn>references</dfn>             | The [=source data item=] referenced by following the defined [path](https://geonovum.github.io/IMX-ModelMapping/#dfn-path-expression) starting from the [=start node=].                                                          |
| <dfn>start node</dfn>             | The [=source object=] from which the [path](https://geonovum.github.io/IMX-ModelMapping/#dfn-path-expression) is followed to find the used data item.                                                                            |

A [path mapping](https://geonovum.github.io/IMX-ModelMapping/#dfn-path-mapping) consists out of one [path](https://geonovum.github.io/IMX-ModelMapping/#dfn-path-expression); possibly yielding any number of [data items](https://geonovum.github.io/IMX-Metadata/#dfn-data-item), when executed. The lineage should give insights on precisely how each [data item](https://geonovum.github.io/IMX-Metadata/#dfn-data-item) was found and how it contributed to the generation of the [=orchestrated data item=]. For each `"OrchestrationActivity -used-> DataItem"` we map to the respective [path](https://geonovum.github.io/IMX-ModelMapping/#dfn-path-expression).

We do this by further deconstructing the [=path mapping execution=] into each [path](https://geonovum.github.io/IMX-ModelMapping/#dfn-path-expression) that is defined in the mapping. For each [=path execution=] that informs the [=path mapping execution=] a [=used=] property is linked to the respective [path](https://geonovum.github.io/IMX-ModelMapping/#dfn-path-expression) in the [model mapping](https://geonovum.github.io/IMX-ModelMapping/#dfn-imx-model-mapping). This allows us to point to the exact mapping element providing the path that leads us to the [=source data item=]. A pointer to the node from which the path is followed is added, this is the [=start node=].

| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <dfn>Path execution</dfn> | A path execution is an [=orchestration activity=] that is part of the [=path mapping execution=].                                                    |
| <dfn>source object</dfn>  | A source object is an [object](https://geonovum.github.io/IMX-Metadata/#dfn-object) that that is referenced to create an [=orchestrated data item=]. |

In this model several types have different roles following from incomming relations. This could make the datamodel less clear. In the following diagram roles are made explicit.

![](media/level4.2.png "Orchestrated data item is generated by a property mapping execution, referencing source data items")


In JSON this could look as follows.

```json
{
  "identification": "G0200.42b3d39246840268e0530a0a28492340",
  "constructionDate": "2006",
  "hasLineage": {
    "orchestratedProperties": [
      { <!-- OrchestratedDataItem -->
        "property": "bouwjaar",
        "value": {
          "stringValue": "2006"
        },
        "subject": {
          "identificatie": "G0200.42b3d39246840268e0530a0a28492340",
          "domein": null
        },
        "wasGeneratedBy": { <!-- PropertyMappingExecution -->
          "used" : {  <!-- property mapping -->
            "objectKey": "MAP.IMXGEO.000102",
            "objectType": "PropertyMapping"
          }
          "wasInformedBy": { <!-- PathMappingExecution -->
            "references": { <!-- source data item -->
                "property": "oorspronkelijkBouwjaar",
                "value": {
                  "stringValue": "2006"
                },
                "subject": {
                  "objectKey": "0200100000085932",
                  "objectType": Pand
                }
              },
              "used": { <!-- Path -->
                "path": {
                  "segments": [
                    "isGerelateerdAan",
                    "oorspronkelijkBouwjaar"
                  ]
                }
              },
              "startNode": { <!-- SourceObject -->
                "objectKey": "G0200.42b3d39246840268e0530a0a28492340",
                "objectType": "Pand"
              }
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

When multiple source data items are used this would result in multiple `"wasInformedBy": { ... }` statements within the `"wasGeneratedBy":{ ... }` element.

#### Summary

The requirements are reflected in the model by introducing the following concepts:

- **Data item**
  - "orchestrated data item" for req 1
  - "source data item" for req 2.

  In order to be able to talk about them.
- **Orchestration Activity**
  - Property Mapping execution and propertyMapping execution for req 3

  In order to describe that orchestration took place.
- **Data source** for req 4.

  In order to decribe where source data is retrieved from and thus can be found.
- **Mapping element**
  -  Property Mapping and path for req 5.

  In order to precisely indicate what rules were applied to the source data to derive the orchestrated data item(s).

In short:

![](media/summary.png)


#### Limitations

- We don't indicate the order of the activities or path segments which is an important aspect of the mapping
- We don't have a way of describing the (software) agent responsible for the orchestration (can be copied from PROV-O).
- We don't describe objecttype mapping executions.
- ...
