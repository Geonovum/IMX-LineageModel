## Analysis

### Context 

In today's complex and interconnected world, the answers that people are seeking often require access to data from multiple registries. This is because the information needed to answer a question or solve a problem is often distributed across multiple sources and domains. Data needs to be aggregated and consolidated in order to satify user needs. This needs to be done transparently. It should be clear where the resulting data came from and what has been done to it. For this, insight into lineage of data should be provided.

The lineage model explained in this document provides a standardised way to work with, store and communicate lineage information of data.
