## Analysis

### Context 

*Beschrijf hier de context van het rapport, waar gaat het over, waarom wordt het geschrevenm, welke vragen worden beantwoord, enz ...* 

In today's complex and interconnected world, the answers that users are seeking often require access to data from multiple registries, as the information needed to answer a question or solve a problem is often distributed across multiple sources and domains. This is also what's done; data is being aggregated and provided though services such as API's. This needs to be done transparently. It should be clear where the data came from and what has been done to it. We need lineage. 

The lineage model explained in this document provides a way to track the origin and transformation of data. Without lineage, it becomes difficult to trace data back to its original sources, leading to potential errors and misunderstandings. Without this lineagemodel it becomes difficult to work with lineage information because there is no single standardised way to work with, store and communicate lineage information.
