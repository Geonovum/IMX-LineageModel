## Introduction

Kadaster and Geonovum are developing a mechanism to facilitate the semantic integration of decentralized data registers. A central API operates on an integrated semantic layer. The semantic layer constitutes of a coherent information model integrating several domain specific domain models. An API orchestration layer directs data communication to and from existing data registries.

Data retrieval is according to the information model of the semantic layer. Data retrieval will optionally include metadata about the lineage (provenance) of the data.

This document specifies the lineage model used and the mechanism to relate the lineage data as metadata to published data.


### Scope

The scope of this lineage model is:

- lineage related to data being published as a result of data integration. The lineage will describe source and process/operation data
- lineage data a data level, meaning the property level of entities
- lineage data at the instance level of properties

This report will also include a specification of relating lineage as metadata to conceptual UML application schema at the property level.



### Target audience

Information modeller, API developer, IT architect.
